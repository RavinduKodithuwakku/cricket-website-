<h1>Types of Cricket matches</h1>
 </div>
<div class="left"></div>
<div class="middle">
<p> Cricket is a game with a very long history,and differernt types of mathces with modified rules have been developed.Basically cricket has
 three formats played at the international level, which are; Test matches, One-Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals.
 These are played under rules and regulations aprroved by ICC(international cricket council).</p>
 
 <h4> Test matches </h4>
<p> Test cricket is the traditional form of the game, which has been played since 1877 and now settled in a five-day format which 
 comprises two innings each. Test cricket is the form of the sport of cricket with the longest match duration, and is considered the game's highest standard.
Test matches are played between national representative teams that have been granted Test status, as determined and conferred by the 
 ICC. The term Test stems from the fact that the long, gruelling matches are mentally and physically testing.
 Two teams of 11 players each play a four-innings match, which may last up to five days (or longer in some historical cases). 
 It is generally considered the most complete examination of a team's endurance and ability.</p>
 <p> The leader of the MRF Tyres ICC Test Match rankings (as on 1 April each year) gets a cash prize of $1 million, 
with the next three teams in the rankings also getting cash awards.</p>

<h4> One-Day Internationals</h4>
<p> One Day Internationals, also known as ODIs, are a pacier format which started in 1971 but gained in popularity from the 1980s.
 A One Day International (ODI) is a form of limited overs cricket, played between two teams with international status, 
 in which each team faces a fixed number of overs, usually 50. The Cricket World Cup, generally held every four years, 
 is played in this format. One Day International matches are also called Limited Overs Internationals (LOI), although this generic term 
 may also refer to Twenty20 International matches. They are major matches and considered the highest standard of List A, limited-overs competition.</p>
<p>The 50-over format has developed in more recent years with the ICC also organising the Champions Trophy for the top eight ranked teams,
 the ICC Womenâ€™s World Cup every four years and the ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup every two years.</p>
 
 
<h4>Twenty20 Internationals </h4>
<p> A Twenty20 International (T20I) is a form of cricket, played between two of the international members of the International Cricket Council (ICC), 
in which each team faces twenty overs. The matches have top-class status and are the highest T20 standard. The game is played under the rules of Twenty20 
cricket. Starting from the format's inception in 2005, T20I status only applied to Full Members and some Associate Member teams. However, in April 2018,
the ICC announced that it would grant T20I status to all its 105 members from 1 January 2019.
A Twenty20 International match is usually competed in three hours and with huge hitting, skillful bowling and amazing fielding it has been hugely popular
 with fans right around the world.</p> 
<p>The ICC World Twenty20 is the premier international T20 tournament which started in 2007, 
and it has been hosted a further five times since then with the advent of the ICC Women's World Twenty20 being hosted alongside the men's event since 2009.
 However, the next edition, to be played in the Caribbean in 2018, it will be a standalone event for the first time. <i class="	fas fa-address-card"> </i></p>
