             <h1>History Of Cricket</h1>

		<h2>Origin</h2>
		
		
		
		<p>Cricket was probably created during Saxon or Norman times by children living in the Weald, 
		   an area of dense woodlands and clearings in south-east England.The first definite reference is dated Monday, 17 January 1597.
           There have been several speculations about the game's origins including some that it was created in France or Flanders.
           It is generally believed that cricket survived as a children's game for many generations before it was increasingly taken up by adults around the beginning of the 17th century. 
		   Possibly cricket was derived from bowls,assuming bowls is the older sport, by the intervention of a batsman trying to stop the ball from reaching its target by hitting it away.
		   Playing on sheep-grazed land or in clearings, the original implements may have been a matted lump of sheep's wool.</p>
		   
		<p>Cricket began to spread with Britains’ Imperialist ambitions, the Navy and Army were instrumental in its spread into the Colonies, with games 
		   being recorded in North America in the 1700’s.In the 1800’s cricket had reached the West Indies and India, by 1788 at the inception of colonization 
		   in Australia the game was played and in the 19th century cricket had reached and was being played in South Africaand New Zealand.</p>
		
		<h2>Beginning of International Cricket</h2>
		
		<p>The first International match was staged in New York in 1844 between Canada and the United States. In 1868 an Australian Aboriginal side toured England and by 1877 England played
		   their first match against Australia to begin the games oldest rivalry.In 1882 England lost to Australia, a mock obituary was written for English cricket and two Melbourne ladies burnt
		   a bail and presented it to the England cricket captain in an urn.<br><br>Thus began the Ashes,the games longest running saga as the two sides play 
		   off every two years for the fabled urn.In 1889 South Africa became the third test nation.In 1900 cricket made its one and only appearance at the Olympics, England played France and won.
		   In 1889 the four balls per over was replaced by a five balls per over and then this was changed to the current six balls per over in 1900.</p>
		   
		<h2>Test Cricket Growth</h2>
		
		<p> By 1909 the Imperial Cricket Conference was formed to administrate the game, primarily from an English perspective, with England, South Africa and Australia being its founder members.
            India, the West Indies and New Zealand saw them become Test playing nations before the second WW, Pakistan joining after.
            Affiliate nations like Sri Lanka, formerly Ceylon, Zimababwe and Bangladesh have become Test playing nations toward the end of the 20th century.</p>
		
		<h2>Limited Overs Cricket</h2>
		
		<p> The first limited-overs international match took place at Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1971.This format was turned out to be immensely popular. 
		    The International Cricket Council reacted to this development by organising the first Cricket World Cup in England in 1975, with all the Test-playing
			nations taking part.As the One Day game developed it brought with it some of the innovations from Tennis and American football, the use of technology 
			to bring better decision making for umpires and to highlight areas of interest for the TV audience.Then Twenty Twenty Cricket was born in England in the early 2000’s, 
			it literally exploded into new market places in cricket, it brought with it a new audience and target market.</p>
